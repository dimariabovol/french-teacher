- Always work on one task at a time from TODO.md
- After completing a task:
  - Ask me for approval before marking it as done
  - Once approved, update TODO.md by checking off the item
  - Then, commit the changes with a clear, relevant message
  - Never skip or reorder TODO items unless explicitly approved
