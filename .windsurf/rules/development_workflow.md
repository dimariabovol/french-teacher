# Development Workflow

- Maintain a clean, organized codebase
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets â€” always use `.env`
- Don't write one-time scripts in permanent files
- Never (re)start the server - always ask me
- Never leave **unstaged/untracked** files after committing
- When dealing with `.env` files, always ask for confirmation for changes
